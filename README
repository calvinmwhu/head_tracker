A google glass app that tracks user's head movement and rotation, implemented with Android 19 and compiled with Google Glass development kit. User is able to "calibrate" the angle to specify the starting point and send data using TCP socket to a remote server in real time. This app is used as an auxilary functionality for a research project I'm doing this semester that needs to remotely retrieve user's head orientation in real time.
